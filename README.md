## Notes from the author
I would just like to preface this with the fact that I might have gone a tad off topic with my essay, choosing to explore how there are so few people like me in software and the difficulties that it raises for under-represented students/workers rather than focusing on one individual. This is an area that I feel very passionately about and I really hope that at least you find my essay to be engaging and eye opening.
